# Examples for CVE-2022-24999 ( qs vulnerabilities )

This repository give some samples of a prototype override vulnerability found in the "qs" NPM package.

## qs vulnerabilities ( ./qs_vulns )

By setting an Array in the “__ proto__” property via "qs", we’ve been able to create “array-like” objects.

As the resulting Objects inherit the “Array” prototype, they provide the native Array functions.
But as they still are Objects, “qs” allow setting the “length” property on them.

As an example, the following payload will create this kind of “evil” array :

    categories[__proto__]&categories[__proto__]&categories[length]=100000000

Thus, setting an unreasonable "length" value on them will freeze the node process as soon as it tries to convert them to string values or by calling most native Array functions.

This expose any node application using a vulnerable version of "qs" to easy Applicative DDOS attack.
